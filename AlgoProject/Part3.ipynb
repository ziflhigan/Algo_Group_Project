The dynamic programming approach is more efficient as it avoids recomputing the same subproblems by storing the results in a memoization table. The greedy approach is the simplest and fastest among the three, but it may not always provide the optimal solution. In this case, the dynamic programming approach is the best as it guarantees the optimal solution while being more efficient than the brute force approach. The greedy approach can be a good choice if the problem constraints allow for it and the goal is to find a near-optimal solution quickly."

The space complexity is O(n) to store the combination and value of each subset. The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach is O(n*W) where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight, as it computes the value of each subproblem once and reuses it when needed. The space complexity is O(n*W) to store the results of the subproblems in a memoization table. The time complexity of the greedy approach is O(nlogn) as it involves sorting the items based on certain criteria. The space complexity is O(n) to store the sorted items. In terms of efficiency, the dynamic programming approach is the most efficient for this problem as it guarantees the optimal solution with a polynomial time complexity and space complexity."
